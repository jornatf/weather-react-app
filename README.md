# Weather React App

Get weather in realtime [HERE](https://weather-react-app-demo.vercel.app).

> This is my first React App that I developed to learn this framework. This app communicates with [Weather API](https://weatherapi.com).

## How it works ?

> When you open the app, you are automatically geolocated. The API provides weather information based on your location (latitude and longitude). Weather infos refresh every minute but you can force the loading by clicking on the **Force refresh** button.
